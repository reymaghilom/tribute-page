          With her knowledge of local food properties, Orosa also made
          contributions in the culinary realm.
        </h1>
        <p>
          <b>1893 – 1945</b> She experimented with foods native to the
          Philippines and formulated food products like calamansi nip, a
          desiccated and powdered form of calamansi that could be used to make
          calamansi juice, banana ketchup, and a powdered preparation of
          soybeans called Soyalac, a "magic food" preparation which helped save
          the lives of thousands of Filipinos, Americans, and other nationals
          who were held prisoner in different Japanese concentration camps
          during World War II.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In 1915</b> She enrolled in the University of the Philippines to
          study pharmacy. She was not able, however, to finish the course in
          Manila. She was sent to the United States by the government to
          continue her studies. She finished her pharmacy course in America in
          1918. Then she studied food chemistry. While studying in the United
          States, Maria had to work in order to have enough money for her
          expenses. She washed dishes in the restaurants, scrubbed floors,
          picked fruits, and worked in canning factories. The United States
          government paid only part of her expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In 1922</b> Maria returned to the Philippines. Upon her return she
          taught home economics in the Centro Escolar University. Then in 1923
          she transferred to the Bureau of Science. It was in this Bureau that
          she worked out different methods of preserving fruits, foods, and
          fruit juices. She also found a way to make darak edible. Darak is a
          valuable food element that can help cure patients suffering from
          beri-beri. With her helpers Maria then taught many housewives how to
          preserve such native foods as adobo, mechado, dinuguan, and to convert
          our fruits as guavas, mangoes into jelly. Maria gave lectures on food
          preservation in the provinces.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In 1928</b> The Government saw her excellent work, then She was
          asked to study the best methods of food preservation. After studying
          again in the United States, she visited China, Hawaii, Holland,
          England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France to observe their ways of
          preserving foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In 1929</b> Maria returned and devoted her time to teaching home
          making to other women. She encouraged them to form rural improvement
          clubs. The purposes of these clubs were:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>To learn and teach home making.</li>
          <li>To learn and teach child care.</li>
          <li>To learn and teach meal planning.</li>
          <li>To learn and teach food preparation and preservation.</li>
          <li>To learn and teach poultry raising</li>
          <li>To learn and teach gardening.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Maria worked hard to organize such clubs all over the country. She had
          organized 537 clubs by 1941. Maria encouraged the members to engage in
          home industries such as making slippers, rugs, and baskets. Maria
          hoped that through her work she would improve the health of mothers
          and children of the country. She also believed that homes with gardens
          would be better places to live in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In 1945 </b>Maria was at work at the Bureau of Plant Industry in
          San Andres. She was hit by shrapnel during the bombing. Her friends
          rushed her to the Remedios Hospital in Malate. Then the hospital
          itself was hit by bombs. The bombs killed Maria and other patients. By
          the death of Maria Orosa, the country lost a woman who had devoted all
          her life to the service of the people. One of the buildings of the
          Bureau of Plants Industry where she worked has been named after her.
          It is called the Maria Y. Orosa building. The great work which Maria
          Orosa started goes on today. Many people whom she trained and taught
          carry on the work of improving the life of the common people.

          "“The moment we begin to fear the opinions of others and hesitate to
          tell the truth that is in us, and from motives of policy are silent
          when we should speak, the divine floods of light and life no longer
          flow into our souls.”"
